TODO:
Next time:
- implement clustering
*****
- do clusterings from nlp project, basically i guess this will be enough to report something, and then
try to find interesting things in the clustering analysis


QUESTIONS:
how to deal with multi-word phrases in cosine similarity when dealing with non-word elements (ie event
triggers or named entities)? -> can a term_set of common bi or trigrams be a thing?


IDEAS:
do statistical correlation type analysis to see if kl/cos_sim using subsets of the document template
correlate to the relationsip the topics or subtopics have with each other (ie. someone checking into rehab
or a bomb going off somewhere or elections -> these things implying a relationship hypothetically
mostly captured by some subset of the document template)
dataset analysis:
inter-cluster similarity (and visualization) among subtopics and subtopics, and generally


clustering features:
event gold
within-doc gold event coreference chains
srl predicates
within-doc srl coreference chains
raw text
~~ ideas:
major mentions

"ACTION" : [],
"LOCATION" : [],
